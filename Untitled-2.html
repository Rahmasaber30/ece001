        An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, 
        and provides common services for computer programs.
        Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software 
        for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources.
